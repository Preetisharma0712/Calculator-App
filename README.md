# Calculator-App

A calculator, for us, is a self-contained, robust, simple to use software device which supports working 
in some area analogous to the  way the familiar,hand-held, electronic calculator supports working in arithmetic.
 
The traditional calculator supports the users in arithmetic tasks by relieving them of the burden of carrying 
out the arthmetic operation,allowing them to concentrate on the substance of the problem at hand. 

The aim of the calculator developed or borrowed in this project was to support learning to program and understanding 
and use of the language.

An important design feature of a calculator should be that it can be used without a great 
deal of explanation and instruction.
